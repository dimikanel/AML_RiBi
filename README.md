# AML_RiBi
Ribosome Biogenesis (RiBi) studies in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)

The analysis aims at building a RiBi-based gene signature in AML. Differential expressed (DE) genes between AML and healthy subjects from 3 different cohorts are subset to include only RiBi-related genes. These are subsequnelty used in building a patient-centered RiBi score through a COX regression model. The model is validated in a seperate cohort. The analysis includes further an integration part of RiBi score and drug screen data and analysis of the RiBi profile in a single-cell dataset.
